## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of the Hybrid programming language seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, please report it through the following channel:

1. **Email:** Send a detailed report to **security@devhybrid.org**.
2. **Details:** Include a description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and any potential exploit code or "Proof of Concept" (PoC).

### Our Response Process

After receiving your report:
* We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
* We will send a follow-up indicating whether we can confirm the vulnerability and our planned timeline for a fix.
* Once a fix is verified, we will release a new version and credit you for the discovery (if desired).

We ask that you practice **Responsible Disclosure** by giving us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before making any information public.
